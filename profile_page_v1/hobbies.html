        <p>I always try to do at least one of these listed activites everyday because I believe that it ends up really helping me when I have to get back to working the next day. Whether it helps me creatively or just helps ease my mind off of stress that might accumulate through the day, I find my hobbies are a necessary part of my life and workflow. Of course I never let hobbies get in the way of work and more important life activites, but they are in my mind a huge part of what makes me such an effective worker and overall decent person to interact with in the workspace. I can't imagine myself being the person I am now without them adding what each of them do to my life, thought process, and approach to any scenario I may find my self in.</p>
