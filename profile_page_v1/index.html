        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring Web Developer and Robotics Engineer. I have always been interested in computers and what makes them tick since I was young, whether it be building them or disassembling them I always can be found messing about with all sorts of tech. Which is why I would love to start working in the industry and learn more everyday about the software side of it all.</p>
